                Skills are divided into four disciplines. Each discipline is then divided into eleven levelsâ€”Star 1-10 and Gold. Each level contains a number of skills and is completed upon the passing of the assessment.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Ice Dance:</strong> <br />
                Composed of steps, turns, and movements placed on a pattern and skated to music. This discipline teaches edges, flow, control, unison, musicality, and timing. These skills are first taught in isolation and then placed on a pattern. May be performed solo, shadowed, or with a partner.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Skating Skills:</strong> <br />
                Edges, turns, steps, and field movements make up this discipline. These skills are the basic components of all figure skating and can be found in the three other disciplines. The skills are judged on edge quality, control, power, and speed.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Artistic:</strong> <br />
                Designed to challenge a skater's musicality, expression, movement, and creativity. This discipline gives the skaters the opportunity to explore the performance aspect of skating.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>Free Skate:</strong> <br />
                Consists of jumps, spins, footwork, and stroking. These skills are performed individually or in sequences. This discipline is split into program performance and elements in isolation assessments.
